# Project Description

This is homework 2 for OSU CS325.

Program stoogesort implements stooge sort algorithms by
python. It reads integers from data.txt and write the result
into stooge.out file.


# Getting Started
In order to run the program, you need first put data.txt in the
root folder. Then you need to compile stoogesort.py using python. 
It is recommended using python 3.6.5. However, other version
of python might also compile the file.

# Result
After running the program stoogesort.py, it will generate stooge.out
containing sorted number.
