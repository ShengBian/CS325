# Project Description

This is homework 1 for OSU CS325.

Program insertsort implements insertion sort algorithms by
python. It read integers from data.txt and write the result
into insert.out file.

Program mergesort implements merge sort algorithms by
python. It read integers from data.txt and write the result
into merge.out file.

# Getting Started
In order to run the program, you need first put data.txt in the
root folder. Then you need to compile insertsort.py and mergesort.py
using python. It recommended using python 3.6.5. However, other version
of python might also compile the file.

# Result
After running the program insertsort.py , it will generate insert.out
containing sorted number.
After running the program mergesort.py , it will generate merge.out
containing sorted number.
